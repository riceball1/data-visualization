## Using React to Create SVG

[Let's Make a Face Part II (React) 57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LhoCfjm8R4&t=3422s) 
 
## Getting Started
- This uses CDN versions of React and ReactDOM
- The `main.js` is where the react code lives, using vanilla JavaScript, and not jsx
- To avoid CORs policy I used `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` locally
