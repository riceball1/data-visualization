## Define Visualization
- Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.
- Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods

## Why Visualization?
- long-term use for end users (e.g., exploratory analysis of scientific data)
- presentation of known results
- stepping stone to better understanding of requirements before developing models
- help developers of automatic solution refine/debug, determine parameters
- help end users of automatic solutions verify, build trust

## Why D3 and React?
- They do not have the abstraction barrier that limits them like other tools
    - E.g., Tools like Python, Tableau and Power BI have limited interaction and customization


## What are Web Technologies?
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG
## Why use Web Technologies?
- Accessible by anyone with a web browser
- No need to install anything locally
- Advanced frontend engineering approaches
- Custom, bespoke design work is possible
- Unlimited potential for adding interactivity
