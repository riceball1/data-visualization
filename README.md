## Define Visualization
- Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.
- Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods

## Why Visualization?
- long-term use for end users (e.g., exploratory analysis of scientific data)
- presentation of known results
- stepping stone to better understanding of requirements before developing models
- help developers of automatic solution refine/debug, determine parameters
- help end users of automatic solutions verify, build trust
